                    <h4>Method</h4>
                    The cameras we simulated in class simulated pinhole cameras. This technique expands the size of the
                    "lens" and collects ten different images taken from locations slightly offset from the real camera
                    position and then composites them together in a technique simulating an accumulation buffer. <br><br>
                    Each of the ten cameras that contributes to the final image is simply the original "LookAt" matrix
                    with its "eye" component modified. A bokeh vector is added to the eye component. The bokeh vector
                    for each channel is calculated with this formula:
                    <div>
                        <span class="code-snippet">(p_right * Math.cos(angle) + p_up * Math.sin(angle)) * aperture</span> <br>
                        where <span class="code-snippet">p_right</span> and <span class="code-snippet">p_up</span> are the
                        vectors defining the plane perpendicular to the direction the camera is looking in <br>
                        and <span class="code-snippet">angle</span> represents the angle the camera is looking at. <br>
                        Lastly, <span class="code-snippet">aperture</span> here is specified by the user. It controls
                        how far away from the center the camera should be moved. Low apertures will be close to center,
                        while high ones are farther away.
                    </div><br>
                    Sort of like with the jittering effect we discussed during the aliasing lecture, taking multiple
                    offset pictures and then blending them together helps us to get a softer view of the image. In
                    regards to depth of field effects, the offset images will line up most when the object is in focus
                    and least when it is completely out of focus. <br><br>
                    I've found that the best visualization of what this method is doing happens in Coin Mode. Hit 'C' to
                    enter Coin Mode and then angle the boat towards the coin. If you bring the camera out of focus, you
                    can see a ring of ten coins. These exist on a plane perpendicular to the angle the camera is
                    pointing in. As you bring the scene into focus, you can see the coins move towards each other and
                    start to overlap.
